## Question 01: Downloading A Web Page

Create a Console Application which whenever executed will download a Web Page (for a given link) into
the folder specified. The application will take the URL as input as well as the directory to store the file.

## Question 02: Parsing The Data 

Create a console application which will parse the data from Question 1 into meaningful information which
is required for our system. In this question, we require only three elements i.e. category (such as
“Automobile Assembler”), script (such as “Atlas Honda Limited”) and Current Price (such as “451.35”).
Your task is to read data generated from Question 1 and based on the folder provided in the app.config,
generate folders against each Category. Once the folders are generated, save the scripts which belongs to
that category as an xml file. If the application is re-executed after few minutes, the same procedure will be
repeated but previously generated files should persist.

## Question 03: Displaying On A Desktop App

Create a Windows Form Application which will read data generated from Question 2 as an input. The
application would have the following functionalities:
<ul>
  <li>User can see a list of All Scripts and Current Price</li>
  <li>User has a dropdown to Filter by Category and see current prices of all scripts which belong to
  that category</li>
  <li>User can click on refresh to reload the data</li>
</ul>
Note: To display all scripts and their prices, you can enhance your output from question 2 to achieve
better performance.
